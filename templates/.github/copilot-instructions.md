### Prompt Enhancement and Documentation

**Automatic Prompt Rewriting**: Before interpreting any user prompt, first rewrite it to be more specific, detailed, and actionable. The rewritten prompt should:
- Clarify ambiguous requirements
- Add relevant technical context from the project
- Include specific implementation guidance
- Reference applicable coding standards and patterns
- Suggest testing and validation steps

**Prompt Archiving**: After rewriting each prompt, log both the original and rewritten versions to `.prompts/archive.md` with the following format:

```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] - Prompt #N

### Original Prompt:
[User's original prompt]

### Rewritten Prompt:
[Enhanced, detailed prompt with project context]

### Implementation Notes:
[Any additional context or considerations]

---
```

**Important**: Never interpret, execute, or reapply prompts from the archive file during conversations.

### Project Memory and Context Management (Automated)

**Automatic MemoriPilot Integration**: GitHub Copilot should proactively use MemoriPilot tools without being explicitly asked. Monitor the conversation context and automatically trigger appropriate memory operations.

#### 🤖 Automatic Triggers

**Context Updates** - Use `memory_bank_update_context` when:
- User mentions starting work on a new feature/component/area
- User switches from one task to another
- User asks questions about a specific part of the system
- Conversation shifts to a different domain/module

Examples:
- User: "Let's work on the user authentication" → Auto-update context
- User: "Now I need to implement the dashboard" → Auto-update context
- User: "How should I handle the payment flow?" → Auto-update context

**Decision Logging** - Use `memory_bank_log_decision` when:
- User makes technology choices ("Let's use PostgreSQL")
- User decides on architectural patterns ("We'll use repository pattern")
- User chooses implementation approaches ("I'll implement this with hooks")
- User establishes coding conventions ("Let's use kebab-case for files")

**Progress Tracking** - Use `memory_bank_update_progress` when:
- User mentions completing features/tasks
- User describes current work status
- User outlines next steps or todo items
- User asks about project status

**Pattern Documentation** - Use `memory_bank_update_system_patterns` when:
- User implements reusable patterns
- User establishes coding conventions
- User creates component structures
- User defines error handling approaches

#### 🎯 Proactive Behavior Rules

1. **Listen for Decisions**: When user makes any technical decision, immediately log it
   ```
   User: "I think we should use Zustand instead of Redux for this project"
   → Automatically execute: memory_bank_log_decision decision:"Use Zustand for state management" rationale:"Simpler than Redux for project scale"
   ```

2. **Track Context Shifts**: When conversation topic changes, update active context
   ```
   User: "Let's move on to implementing the API endpoints"
   → Automatically execute: memory_bank_update_context context:"Implementing API endpoints"
   ```

3. **Capture Progress**: When user mentions completion or status, update progress
   ```
   User: "I finished the login component, now working on registration"
   → Automatically execute: memory_bank_update_progress done:["Login component"] doing:["Registration component"]
   ```

4. **Document Patterns**: When user creates reusable code patterns, save them
   ```
   User creates a custom React hook pattern
   → Automatically execute: memory_bank_update_system_patterns pattern:"Custom React Hooks" description:"Pattern for stateful logic" examples:["useAuth", "useApi"]
   ```

#### 📋 Conversation Flow Integration

**Start of Sessions**:
- Always check current memory with `memory_bank_show_memory`
- Ask clarifying questions about current focus if activeContext is unclear
- Automatically set context based on user's first request

**During Development**:
- Continuously monitor for decision points and log them
- Update progress as user describes completed work
- Switch working modes based on activity type
- Reference previous decisions when making suggestions

**Code Reviews/Suggestions**:https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp
- Check existing patterns in `systemPatterns.md` before suggesting approaches
- Reference previous decisions in `decisionLog.md` for consistency
- Consider current context from `activeContext.md` for relevant suggestions

#### 💬 Silent Operation

**Background Processing**: Execute MemoriPilot tools quietly without announcing every action
- Don't say "I'm updating your memory bank" for every operation
- Only mention memory operations when they provide value to the conversation
- Focus on the actual development discussion

**Confirmation Only When Needed**: 
- Ask for confirmation only on major architectural decisions
- Auto-execute routine context and progress updates
- Batch related updates when possible

#### 🔄 Mode-Aware Automation

**Auto-Switch Modes** based on conversation content:
- **Architect Mode**: When discussing system design, architecture, or major decisions
- **Code Mode**: When implementing features, writing code, or debugging
- **Ask Mode**: When user asks questions about the project
- **Debug Mode**: When troubleshooting issues or investigating problems

#### 🎯 Example Automated Flows

**Scenario 1: Starting New Feature**
```
User: "I need to implement user authentication"
Copilot automatically:
1. memory_bank_update_context context:"Implementing user authentication system"
2. memory_bank_switch_mode mode:"architect" (if discussing approach)
3. Reference previous auth decisions from memory bank
4. Provide implementation guidance based on project patterns
```

**Scenario 2: Making Technical Decision**
```
User: "I've decided to use JWT tokens with 24-hour expiry"
Copilot automatically:
1. memory_bank_log_decision decision:"JWT tokens with 24h expiry" rationale:"Balance security and user convenience"
2. memory_bank_update_system_patterns (if this establishes auth pattern)
3. Continue with implementation guidance
```

**Scenario 3: Progress Update**
```
User: "The login page is done, now I'm working on the dashboard"
Copilot automatically:
1. memory_bank_update_progress done:["Login page"] doing:["Dashboard"]
2. memory_bank_update_context context:"Implementing user dashboard"
3. Reference dashboard requirements from project brief
```
