# Development Plans

This directory contains development plans for all features and major changes in the project.

## Purpose

Following a **plan-first development approach** ensures:
- Clear understanding of requirements before implementation
- Manageable, iterative development steps
- Opportunity for review and course correction
- Better code quality through thoughtful design
- Reduced risk of over-engineering or missing requirements

## Plan Structure

Each plan should follow this naming convention:
- `feature-[name]-plan.md` - For new features
- `refactor-[component]-plan.md` - For refactoring work
- `fix-[issue]-plan.md` - For complex bug fixes
- `migration-[description]-plan.md` - For data/code migrations

## Plan Template

Use this template for all development plans:

```markdown
# Development Plan: [Feature/Task Name]

## Objective
[Clear, concise description of what needs to be built/changed]

## Current State Analysis
- What currently exists
- What needs to change
- Dependencies and constraints
- Technical considerations

## Implementation Steps
1. **Step 1**: [Specific, focused task]
   - Files to modify: `path/to/file.ts`
   - Expected outcome: Clear deliverable description
   - Testing requirements: What tests to write/update
   - Estimated time: 15-30 minutes

2. **Step 2**: [Next specific task]
   - Dependencies: Requires Step 1 completion
   - Files to modify: `path/to/other/file.ts`
   - Expected outcome: Clear deliverable description
   - Testing requirements: Integration tests
   - Estimated time: 20 minutes

[Continue for 3-7 steps total]

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Specific, measurable outcome 1
- [ ] All existing tests continue to pass
- [ ] New functionality is properly tested
- [ ] Code follows project standards
- [ ] No breaking changes (or documented if necessary)

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for new functions/components
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for user workflows
- Performance tests if applicable

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk 1**: [Description] → **Mitigation**: [Strategy]
- **Risk 2**: [Description] → **Mitigation**: [Strategy]

## Review Points
- After Step [X]: Review [specific aspect]
- After Step [Y]: Test [specific functionality]
- Before completion: Final integration testing

## Completion Checklist
- [ ] All implementation steps completed
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Plan archived with completion notes

---

## Implementation Log
[Add notes during implementation about discoveries, changes, etc.]

### Step 1 - [Date]
[Notes about implementation, any issues encountered, decisions made]

### Step 2 - [Date]
[Continue logging each step...]

## Completion Notes - [Date]
[Final notes about the implementation, lessons learned, future considerations]
```

## Workflow

1. **Planning Phase**
   - Create plan using template above
   - Get developer approval before implementation
   - Revise plan if needed

2. **Implementation Phase**
   - Implement one step at a time
   - Get review and commit after each step
   - Update plan if course correction needed

3. **Completion Phase**
   - Verify all success criteria met
   - Update completion notes
   - Archive plan for future reference

## Active Plans

- [ ] [Plan Name](./plan-file.md) - Status: In Progress
- [x] [Completed Plan](./completed-plan.md) - Status: Completed

## Completed Plans Archive

Completed plans serve as valuable documentation and reference for:
- Understanding project evolution
- Learning from past decisions
- Estimating future similar work
- Onboarding new team members
