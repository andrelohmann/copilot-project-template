# Development Plan: [Feature/Task Name]

## Objective
[Clear, concise description of what needs to be built/changed]

## Current State Analysis
- What currently exists
- What needs to change
- Dependencies and constraints
- Technical considerations

## Implementation Steps

1. **Step 1**: [Specific, focused task]
   - Files to modify: `path/to/file.ts`
   - Expected outcome: Clear deliverable description
   - Testing requirements: What tests to write/update
   - Estimated time: 15-30 minutes

2. **Step 2**: [Next specific task]
   - Dependencies: Requires Step 1 completion
   - Files to modify: `path/to/other/file.ts`
   - Expected outcome: Clear deliverable description
   - Testing requirements: Integration tests
   - Estimated time: 20 minutes

3. **Step 3**: [Continue pattern...]
   - Dependencies: Requires Step 2
   - Files to modify: `path/to/another/file.ts`
   - Expected outcome: Clear deliverable description
   - Testing requirements: E2E tests
   - Estimated time: 25 minutes

[Continue for 3-7 steps total]

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Specific, measurable outcome 1
- [ ] All existing tests continue to pass
- [ ] New functionality is properly tested
- [ ] Code follows project standards
- [ ] No breaking changes (or documented if necessary)

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for new functions/components
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for user workflows
- Performance tests if applicable

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk 1**: [Description] → **Mitigation**: [Strategy]
- **Risk 2**: [Description] → **Mitigation**: [Strategy]

## Review Points
- After Step [X]: Review [specific aspect]
- After Step [Y]: Test [specific functionality]
- Before completion: Final integration testing

## Completion Checklist
- [ ] All implementation steps completed
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Plan archived with completion notes
